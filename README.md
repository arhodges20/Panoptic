# Panoptic
Panoptic: Lightweight Endpoint Monitoring PoC 
Panoptic is a proof of concept (PoC) for a lightweight, centralized endpoint monitoring solution inspired by the idea of a digital panopticon—a single-pane control tower for managing and securing an organization’s endpoints.
Current Features in Progress

    Endpoint Agent: Collects system metrics (CPU and memory usage) and transmits them to a central server.
    Centralized Server:
        Receives and stores data from agents.
        Provides a basic API for querying system stats.
    Simple CLI: Command-line interface for interacting with the server and agents.

Planned Features

    Advanced metrics (e.g., disk usage, network activity).
    Agent command execution (e.g., quarantine, process termination).
    Real-time data visualization.
    Web-based GUI for enhanced usability.

Goals

    Demonstrate the feasibility of a lightweight, modular endpoint monitoring system.
    Serve as a learning platform for cybersecurity and system monitoring concepts.
    Provide a foundation for building more advanced monitoring and response tools.
